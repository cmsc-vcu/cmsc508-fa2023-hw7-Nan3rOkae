# What does this assigmnet have:

- So this assignment requires us to develope sql tables and insert spesific data into them to be then queried with speific commands

- We have a people table that contains the id, first name, last name, and email of a person
- We have a skills table that contains the id, name, tag, and description of a skill
- We have a roles table that contains the id, name, and description of a role
- We have a people_skills table that contains the id of a person and the id of a skill
- We have a people_roles table that contains the id of a person and the id of a role


Understanding this made developing databases and querying them a lot easier
