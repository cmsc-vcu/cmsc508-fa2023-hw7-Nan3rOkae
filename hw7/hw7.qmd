## Overview and description

- So this assignment requires us to develope sql tables and insert spesific data into them to be then queried with speific commands

- We have a people table that contains the id, first name, last name, and email of a person
- We have a skills table that contains the id, name, tag, and description of a skill
- We have a roles table that contains the id, name, and description of a role
- We have a people_skills table that contains the id of a person and the id of a skill
- We have a people_roles table that contains the id of a person and the id of a role

## Crows-foot diagram

- In the given ER diagram, the **skills** entity records various abilities with details, which are linked to **people** through the **peopleskills** associative entity, representing a many-to-many relationship where a person can have multiple skills and a skill can be held by multiple people. Similarly, **people** are associated with **roles** through the **peopleroles** entity, indicating that a person can fulfill multiple roles and a role can be assigned to many people.

## Examples of data in the database

For the people, skills, and roles tables, provide a description of each table and it's contents. Then provide a listing of the entire table.

### People table

The *people* table contains elements that describe the id,first_name, last_name, email, linkedin_url, headshot_url, discord_handle, brief_bio, and the date_joined

Below is a list of data in the *people* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from people;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Skills table

The *skills* table contains elements that describe the id, name, description, tag, url, and the time_commitment

Below is a list of data in the *skills* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from skills;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

### Roles table

The *roles* table contains elements that describe the  id, name, and sort_priority of each role

Below is a list of data in the *roles* table.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
sql = f"""
select * from roles;
"""
## Add code to list roles table here
try:
    df = pd.read_sql(sql,cnx)
    df
except Exception as e:
    message = str(e)
    print(f"An error occurred:\n\n{message}\n\nIgnoring and moving on.")
    df = pd.DataFrame()
df
```

## Reflection

- Having this exercise really helped in understanding how queries in Mysql work. This helpes put things into perspective in terms of the project delivarable my partner and I have to get started on. From creating a table, dropping it due to it already existing, inserting data, and running a query; it was honestly a fun assignment.
Understanding the syntax took some time but after much needed practice, it made more sense and debugging was easier.
